# Weather Forecast Website

My project is a weather forecast web page that utilizes the 7Timer API to display the weather forecast for various cities. Users can select a city from a dropdown menu, and the application fetches and displays the weather forecast, including temperature and cloud cover, for the upcoming days. The forecast items are displayed horizontally to enhance user experience.

Key Features:

Dynamic city selection from a dropdown menu populated with data from a CSV file.
Fetching and displaying weather data using the 7Timer API.
Horizontal layout for forecast items to avoid vertical scrolling.
Responsive design for better user experience on different devices.
